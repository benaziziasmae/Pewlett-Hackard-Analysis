Build Employee Database with PostgreSQL and perform SQL queries to explore and analysis data by applying skills of Data Modeling, Data Engineer and Data Analysis.

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to create two tables:

- And the seconde one to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

Within the first table, we included information such as employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date.
